                <h2>A cost effective learning solution for students</h2>

                <p>We're a mobile first publishing company that is developing content for college students in the English speaking world. Our first users are going to be early adopters of technology based learning content who're looking for on-the-go education solutions that help them study efficiently. They will be willing to try chapters at a small fee per chapter or pay an average of $10 per ebook. This segment is likely to be author brand agnostic. Our initial focus is on the US, UK, Canadian and Australian markets.</p>

                <p>Our content will be well written, with easy and quick to find specific topics that they need to learn/revise and test themselves on, and finally buy only the topics/chapters they need. Unlike print books, this content will be updated frequently so that it always remains relevant. Our books will have great graphics and interactive features such as work problems and quizzes, as well as sample examination questions/concepts tested in examinations.</p>

                <p>Our mobile app will be available online on all major app stores, ON THE GO, anytime!</p>

                <p>We're working hard to bring it to you in a few days time, and we look forward to seeing you there, soon.</p>
